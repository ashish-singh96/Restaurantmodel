# Project Overview: Restaurant API

The Restaurant API is a RESTful service that provides functionality to manage restaurant information. It allows users to perform various operations such as retrieving restaurants by ID, getting a list of all restaurants, adding new restaurants, updating restaurant information, and deleting restaurants.</br>

The project is built using the Spring Boot framework, which provides a robust and efficient platform for developing Java-based web applications. It leverages other Spring projects like Spring Web and Spring Data JPA for handling web requests and interacting with the database.</br>

## Key Features:

Get Restaurant by ID: Users can retrieve detailed information about a specific restaurant by providing its unique ID.</br>
Get All Restaurants: Users can fetch a list of all the restaurants available in the system.</br>
Add Restaurant: Users can add new restaurants by providing the necessary details such as name, address, phone number, specialty, and total staff.</br>
Update Restaurant: Users can update the information of an existing restaurant, such as changing its specialty or any other relevant properties.</br>
Delete Restaurant: Users can delete a restaurant from the system, permanently removing its data.</br>
The project uses the H2 Database, an in-memory database, for simplicity and ease of setup. However, it can be easily configured to work with other databases supported by Spring Data JPA.</br>
